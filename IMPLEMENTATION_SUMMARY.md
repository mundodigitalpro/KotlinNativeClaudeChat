## Implementation Summary Report

This report details the recent enhancements and refactorings implemented in the Kotlin/Native AI Chat application.

### Key Features Implemented:

*   **Response Streaming:**
    *   The application now supports real-time streaming of AI model responses, significantly improving perceived speed and user experience.
    *   Ktor client capabilities were leveraged for streaming.
    *   The chat loop logic was modified to process and display response fragments incrementally as they arrive.
*   **Enhanced Main Menu:**
    *   Added a new option to toggle automatic conversation history saving on exit.
    *   Added a new option to customize the assistant's persona.
    *   Added a new option to change the API provider directly from the main menu.
    *   Added a new option to select a model from a comprehensive list of available models (especially for OpenRouter).
    *   Added an explicit "Exit" option to the main menu.
*   **Chat Command Enhancements:**
    *   **`/clear` command:** Users can now clear the current conversation history within a chat session.
    *   **`/config` command:** Users can display the current application configuration (API provider, model, etc.) within a chat session.
    *   **`/save` command:** Users can manually save the current conversation history to a JSON file.
    *   **`/load` command:** Users can load a previous conversation history from a JSON file.
*   **Configuration and Error Handling Improvements:**
    *   Implemented input validation for API key and model name during configuration setup, preventing common errors.
    *   Improved handling of empty inputs during configuration.
    *   Enhanced error messages for OpenRouter API issues (e.g., invalid model ID, model not available).
    *   Added a `validateConfig` function to ensure essential configuration parameters are present before starting a chat session.
*   **Code Refactoring and Maintenance:**
    *   Consolidated duplicate chat session logic into a single, more robust function (`runChatSession`).
    *   Removed redundant variables (`shouldReturnToMenu`).
    *   Fixed a bug that caused the application to crash if `config.json` was missing.
    *   Updated deprecated Kotlin/Native functions (`epochTime` replaced with `kotlin.time.TimeSource.Monotonic.markNow().elapsedNow().inWholeMilliseconds`).
    *   Ensured correct JSON serialization for `List<Message>` when saving/loading conversation history.

### Benefits:

*   **Improved User Experience:** Real-time responses, clear commands, and persistent conversation history make the application more interactive and user-friendly.
*   **Increased Flexibility:** Users have more control over API settings, model selection, and conversation management.
*   **Enhanced Robustness:** Better error handling and input validation lead to a more stable application.
*   **Cleaner Codebase:** Refactorings reduce redundancy and improve maintainability.
